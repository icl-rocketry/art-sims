<h1> Monte Carlo Scripts</h1>

A way to analyse the effects of condition or rocket parameter perturbation on different parameters.
Made using the orhelper (<url>https://github.com/SilentSys/orhelper</url>) package and examples, along with OpenRocket-15.03 (<url>https://openrocket.info/</url>). Also made with help from other members within ART.

Please follow the steps to install orhelper in order to use this script. This is required for the script to be run.

In order for the wind direction and speed variation to be changed (such as to account for different conditions at different locations), please enter the source code and modify the conditions as necessary. The turbulence intensity of the wind and the wind standard deviation are related, so either should be modified but individually. This script configures the turbulence intensity at 10%.
