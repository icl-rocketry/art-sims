# ðŸ¥³ Aero-Sims rule!
Use this repo for all your aero/sims files, except for openrocket files, which are so special we gave them their own repo.

StarCCM+ testing files must be stored in OneDrive due to their large size.

## Contents
**Heating** | Heating calculations (containing errors - do not use!)

**MATLAB** | A couple of useful MATLAB scripts, mostly still under development

**MonteCarlo** | Monte Carlo scripts for sensitivity analysis (redundant under modeFrontier)
